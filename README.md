# SPRINT 1
## TASK 1: Inheritance and Polimorfism

### LEVEL 1
In a music group there are different types of musical instruments. 
There are wind, string and percussion instruments.

All instruments have their name and price as attributes. 
In addition, they have a method called play(). 
This is abstract in the instrument class and, therefore, must be implemented in the child classes. 
If a wind instrument is being played, the method must display on the console:
"A wind instrument is being played", if a string instrument is being played:
"A string instrument is being played" and if a percussion instrument is being played:
"A percussion instrument is being played".

The loading process of a class only takes place once. 
Demonstrate that loading can be caused by the creation of the first instance of this class or by accessing a static member of it.

Find information about initialization blocks and static blocks in Java.

### LEVEL 2
Create a class "Car" with the attributes: make, model, and horsepower. 
The make must be final static, the model static, and the horsepower final. 
Demonstrate the difference between the three. Are there any that can be initialized in the class constructor?

Add two methods to the class "Car". A static method called brake() and a non-static method called accelerate(). 
The accelerate method should output to the console: 
“The vehicle is accelerating” and the brake() method should output: “The vehicle is braking”.

Demonstrate how to invoke the static and non-static methods from the main() of the main class.
